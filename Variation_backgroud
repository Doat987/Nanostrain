#Energy minumum principles

Here is a background introduction on:

-Energy minimum principles
-Calculus of variation

-Free energy minimum principle:

The 2nd law of thermaldynamics state that:
  /for a isolated system, the entropy can only increase/

this means, a system's equilibrim state marked by the realizition of maximum entropy.
famous example including the mixing of different gases and free expansion.

However, if the system is connected to a resovior(enenrgy can be transfer to such resovior) which has a 
constent temperture or pressure. The entropy maximum entropy should be replaced by its mathmatically
equivalent minimum energy priciple for practical reasons.

For example, two cups of water with different temperature mixing, if the cup are under const. T and P.
It will reach equilibrium when its Gibbs free energy reaches minimum.(this statment is not entirely true)

Moreover, since most phenomenon we concerned, like strain or magnetic momentum, is a macroscopic thermodynamic
variables. Many problem can be solved by this priciple.

-Calculus of variation

calculus of variation can solve problem like:
