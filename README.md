# Nanostrain

-This is an attempt to use Finite element, particularly method of finite differencies to calculate
-strain behavior of materials under:

  -bending
  -indentation

-two kind of deformation of materials will be calculated
  
  -small elastic deformation
  -plastic deformation cased by dislocation

-code is write in python, with numpy and scipy modulus.
